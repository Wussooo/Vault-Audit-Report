CRITICAL REENTRANCY VULNERABILITY IN VAULT.SOL

Vulnerability:
- Function: withdraw()
- Issue: External call before state update enables reentrancy.
- Impact: 100% of ETH can be stolen.

Reproduction Steps:
1. Deploy Vault.sol and fund it with ETH.
2. Deploy Attack.sol with Vault's address.
3. Call attack() with 1 ETH.
4. Attacker's receive() will recursively drain funds.

Fix:
Add a reentrancy guard:
1. bool private locked;
2. require(!locked, "Reentrancy detected");
3. locked = true before external calls.
